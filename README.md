Proposed README for Model Dockerizer
üê≥ Model Dockerizer: Your GPU-Optimized Inference Image Builder
Model Dockerizer is a Go CLI tool that automates the creation of production-ready Docker images for your machine learning models. Stop worrying about mismatched dependencies, CUDA versions, or complex Dockerfiles. With a single command, Model Dockerizer takes your model and gives you a runnable container optimized for GPU inference.

‚ú® Key Features
Smart Dockerfile Generation: Automatically builds an optimized Dockerfile for your model based on its framework and dependencies.

CUDA & cuDNN Optimization: Selects the correct NVIDIA base image to ensure compatibility with your GPU hardware.

Dependency Management: Handles pip install commands and other build-time requirements so you don't have to.

Single Binary: A single, self-contained executable that's easy to install and run anywhere.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Install: Download the latest binary from our GitHub releases page and add it to your PATH.

Create a model.yaml file: This file tells Model Dockerizer what to do.

YAML

model_name: "my-first-model"
framework: "pytorch"
model_artifact: "./models/model.pth"
inference_script: "./inference/app.py"
requirements:
  - "torch==2.0.0"
  - "pandas"
  - "fastapi"
Run the command:

Bash

model-dockerizer build --config-file model.yaml --push
This command will:

Generate the Dockerfile.

Build the image.

Tag it.

And push it to your configured container registry.
